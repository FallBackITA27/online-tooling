        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <h3>- Why did you make this?</h3>
        <p>In short: I ran into GTALens' completion limit. In full: I know why they made that a thing and I know why they made themselves make that a thing. They created themselves a problem by saving data on their servers, which cost money to maintain, and instead of moving this data to the local browser storage they decided to make a subscription. I absolutely despise this marketing, so, seen the lack of open source Interactive maps, I tried to make what I could of their minified Vue source code and other interactive maps out there to make a good, up to date, open source one.</p>
        <h3>- How do I contribute?</h3>
        <p>If you know anything about JavaScript, or coding really, just make a pull request on the github page. Otherwise, contact me on discord @fallbackita27 (or anywhere else really) and I'll see what could be done. I'll eventually make a roadmap.</p>
        <h3>- I found a bug!</h3>
        <p>Read the answer above.</p>
        <h3>- I wanna move my data from PC to Mobile</h3>
        <p>This is (currently) not possible. I don't want to and can't make a profile system (not without handling the website's backend first, and sadly Github doesn't allow that). This is why websites require a subscription often times, because to do this you need a server (which takes money to maintain), which is often bought from some service (like DigitalOcean) and that service needs to be paid (at least 8 euros a month). I want to keep this free for myself and for everyone else. I'll eventually make a manual way to move data from one place to the other, but it won't be automatic. I might be banking on some Browser features (like Mozilla's Firefox Sync) eventually, if that's even possible.</p>
